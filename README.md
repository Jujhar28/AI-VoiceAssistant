# Voice-Activated Chatbot with OpenAI

## Overview

This project is a voice-activated chatbot that utilizes OpenAI's GPT-3 model to engage in natural language conversations with users. It allows users to speak to the chatbot, which then processes their speech, generates responses, and speaks back to the user. This README provides an overview of the project, how to set it up, and how to use it.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- OpenAI API key
- Required Python packages (specified in `requirements.txt`)

## Setup

#### 1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/voice-activated-chatbot.git
```

#### 2. Install the required Python packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 3. Obtain an API key from the OpenAI platform and replace `API_KEY` in the code with your actual API key.

## Usage

1. Run the Python script `voice_chatbot.py`:

2. The chatbot will start listening for your voice input. Speak clearly and wait for it to respond.

3. The chatbot will reply to your voice input using text-to-speech.

4. Continue the conversation by speaking to the chatbot, and it will respond accordingly.

## Configuration

You can configure various parameters of the chatbot in the `voice_chatbot.py` script, such as the user's name, bot's name, and the OpenAI engine to use.
